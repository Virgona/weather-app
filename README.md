## Description

A weather app that displays the current weather conditions of the searched city and also the conditions for the following 5 days

## User Story
As a TRAVELLER I want to search the weather conditons of a city
When I Search I can see the current weather containing Temperature, Wind Speed, UV Index and Humidity.
I will also see the conditons for the following 5 days

## Challenges

I find myself struggling with design. Getting elements to sit on the page is something I need to work on more as I spend the majority of my time fiddling with css and the bootstrap api trying to get things placed where I want them.
With this project I ended up abandoning design in general, just getting something very basic and ugly so that I can get all the logic working - though I spent too much time trying to work the design I was very rushed last minute.

On that note, this task really got away from me. My time management was poor and that is reflective of the final product

## Learnings

My poor time managment of this assignment has left me walking away ashamed. To never feel this great shame again going forward I will have a harder grasp of my time management.
I had also overesimated my skills, percieving some tasks to be "easy" and then once going to execute them getting stuck for hours - like making the history buttons on the page. Making them dynamically search on a click was
much harder than I anticipated

## Usage

1. User loads app page
2. user enters the name of a city they wish to know the weather for into the search bar
3. User is presented with its current weather and report over the next 5 days
4. User inputs new city, current city is saved to the history tab and if click will bring its results back up
